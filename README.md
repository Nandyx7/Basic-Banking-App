*GRIP*
I am glad to share the task-2 from the Internship of The Sparks Foundation.

This is nandhini and I have chose the topic Banking System App.

The Languages used to built the application is front end-XML and back end-JAVA through android studio 

The flow of the app is (i)Home screen with 2 butons such as CUSTOMERS and TRANSACTION > (ii)Customers > (iii) Customer List > (iv) View one customer > (v) Customer Details > (vi) 
Transfer Money > (vii) Transfer money to the customer > (viii) Transaction waiting page > (ix) Transaction History

In home screen I used animation for the Bank picture using JSON file and the dependancies are mentioned on the respective file. Homescreen with two buttons. In transaction button only the Transaction history of the customers only visible. In customer button customer details are given

I have used search filter for the ease of the user using this app through the concept Recycler view. While clicking the search image the search filter is available through that we can search the customer easily. It is mainly made because Banking System app is a commercial based app, there we have huge number of customers so using the search filter we could search and find the customer easily

Through the cardView layout the customer details have been given. And in the customer details only name,number,mail Id,Balance are given.

For transaction page I have used some animation from lotteflies of JSON file to make it more realistic like other online banking app 

To store the customer details I have used the concept of DATABASE like creating the Table and Inserting the values into it.

And I have inserted 14 users database and have given specific Profile images individually to look more attractive
Here is the proper layout of the app given here based on the application I finished
